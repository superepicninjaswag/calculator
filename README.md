# Kal-culator
Imagine a journey — a journey that takes you through the intricacies of a language, not just any language, but JavaScript, the lifeblood of the internet. This journey isn't about the destination, but about the path we take, the skills we garner, and the transformation we undergo. What you see before you is not just a 'simple calculator project'. It's a testament to an exploration of JavaScript's fundamental pillars, a seamless fusion of the abstract and the concrete, where theoretical concepts meet tangible results. This project is a symphony of DOM manipulation and event handling, a reflection of not just learning, but understanding, not just coding, but creating. It's not merely about making numbers add up — it's about making every piece of the puzzle fit together in the vast, dynamic canvas of the web. That's the power of JavaScript, and that's the power of this journey.

(This is a Superman themed calculator based on the TI-108. I made it to wrap up my experience learning the basics of JavaScript to create interactive websites)
